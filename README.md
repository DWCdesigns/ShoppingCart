This branch was created after 3 hours of working on the assignment. 

# Questions
The unanswered question is:

-Is it the original git supposed to be branchable? I wasn't able to push my branch through process I normally use.

# Result
  While a workable solution was created there were other features I would have liked to create.
  
  -Clear the list feature. It's possible to do this by clicking the homepage link but undesirable.
  
  -Display cleanup. That was the primary objective in the second branch.
  
  -Asynchronous methods for the Terminal object. I have run into this before but I had to go back to code that is four years old to find the soution. 
  Typically I have a db context that already has async properties or the process doesn't need an asynchronous implementation.
